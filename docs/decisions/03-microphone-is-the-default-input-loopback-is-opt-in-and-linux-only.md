# Microphone is the default input; loopback is opt-in and Linux-only

Portable across OSes with no OS-specific plumbing (loopback setup differs
completely between WASAPI/PulseAudio/CoreAudio), so mic stays the default
and works everywhere unchanged.

`--source loopback` was added 2026-08-18 so the app can be tested by
playing audio through the computer instead of needing a mic to physically
hear a speaker (and, per a live test, keeps working even with the sink
muted, since PipeWire's monitor tap sits upstream of the mute applied on
the path to the physical output on this machine). Implementation:
`audio_capture.resolve_loopback_device()` shells out to
`pactl get-default-sink`, sets `PULSE_SOURCE` to `<sink>.monitor`, and
opens PortAudio's `pulse` device — no new dependency, but PipeWire/
PulseAudio-only (fails with a clear error elsewhere, e.g. macOS/Windows,
which would need a virtual-audio-driver device instead, not implemented).

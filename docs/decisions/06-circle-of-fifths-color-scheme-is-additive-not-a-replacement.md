# Circle-of-fifths color scheme is additive, not a replacement

Chromatic (semitone-order hue) stays the default; `fifths` is opt-in via
`--color-scheme`. The wheel and tab views always show fifths layout
regardless of this flag: `--color-scheme` only affects fill/GUI. Tab
originally followed `--color-scheme` like fill did, but that meant the same
note could render as a different color in `tab` than in `wheel` (e.g. B was
pink under chromatic, green under fifths) — since `tab` and `wheel` are both
meant to show a note's fixed color identity, they now always agree with each
other, matching `wheel`'s existing fifths-only behavior instead of the other
way around.

# Chord mode always runs, `P` is a pure render-thread-local flag

Resolved via live grilling during spec #12's implementation (see wayfinder
map #1, issue #11's resolution comment). The latency budget research
(#8/#10) measured the full chord-mode addition at ~3ms/hop worst case on
a Pi Zero 2 W — a large margin against the 23ms hop budget — so running it
unconditionally every hop, regardless of whether any view has `P` toggled
on, was cheaper than building a mechanism to turn it on/off. Consequence:
`P` needs no shared state at all, unlike `M`'s `SourceState`/
`AudioCapture.restart()` (which changes what's captured); it's exactly the
same shape as `show_debug` in `run_gui`.

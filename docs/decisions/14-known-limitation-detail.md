# Known-limitation detail

- **Octave-error blips during note decay.** YIN can briefly lock onto a
  sub-harmonic as a note's amplitude fades out (harmonics get ambiguous),
  causing a short (~100ms) false reading before self-correcting. Observed
  live during acoustic testing. Not currently worth fixing without a
  concrete complaint — `NoteSmoother`'s median filter/debounce already
  suppresses most single-frame blips; only sustained sub-harmonic locks
  during a fade slip through.
- **Live pitch-tracking quality varies run-to-run** with room acoustics, mic
  gain/AGC settling, and speaker/mic coupling — this is inherent to acoustic
  pitch detection, not a code regression, when comparing two live test runs
  that behave differently.
- **`tab --scroll onset` freezes the display during sustained notes or
  silence, by design** — a new column only appears on a genuine new
  note-attack (`NoteSmoother`'s `is_onset` flag), so a held note or a quiet
  passage simply doesn't advance the scroll. This is expected, not a bug.
- **Very short terminals (fewer than ~22 rows) will clip the outermost
  ledger-line notes** in the `tab` view — the two 5-line staff blocks
  themselves are never shrunk below their 21-row minimum (top=20, bottom=0),
  so on a small terminal, notes far above/below the staff just don't draw
  rather than corrupting the staff layout. Below that 21-row floor (terminal
  height under ~22 rows including the status line), `render()` additionally
  caps how many staff rows it emits at `usable_rows`, cropping off the
  bottom (bass) rows first, rather than writing ANSI cursor-addressing past
  the terminal's actual height — the latter used to scroll/corrupt the
  fixed-position rendering instead of just cropping. Fixed 2026-08-18: two
  related bugs in `TabDisplay.render()` — out-of-range notes were clamped
  onto the boundary staff row instead of dropped (silently misplacing them),
  and the row-emission loop didn't cap at `usable_rows`, so terminals under
  22 rows always wrote past their real height. See
  `tests/test_terminal_tab_display.py`.
- **A minor-7th chord and its relative-major 6th chord are pitch-class-set
  identical** (Am7 = A-C-E-G, C6 = C-E-G-A, always a minor third apart) —
  inherent to the chords themselves, not a matching bug. Without a
  confident bass note, `chord_templates.match()`'s tie-break deterministically
  picks the lower-root-index template; this is the correct behavior for
  "no distinguishing information available," not a wrong answer.
- **A pure (harmonic-free) low bass tone can be misdetected a semitone off**
  by `chroma.fold_bass()` — real bass instruments' overtones resolve this
  correctly (that's the whole point of the harmonic-summing chroma design);
  a synthesized pure sine with no harmonics at all is an edge case not
  representative of real playing, observed during implementation testing
  but not chased further absent a concrete complaint.
